# 🌍 Selim Issı | WebGIS Personal Web Page

Link to web page: https://selimissi.github.io/personal-web-page-selimissi-fork/

## 🎓 Project Information
This project was developed for the **GMT458 – WebGIS** course at **Hacettepe University, Department of Geomatics Engineering**.  
The goal was to design a personal web page using **HTML**, **CSS**, and a **web mapping library** (OpenLayers or equivalent).

---

## 🧭 Project Overview
The website introduces me both as a **geomatics engineering student** and a **pilot trainee**.  
It contains personal information, social media links, and an interactive map showing a **navigation flight route over Ankara**.

---

## 🗂️ Project Structure
- `index.html` — Home page with short introduction  
- `hakkimda.html` — About page (education and pilot training background)  
- `sosyal.html` — Social page with contact links  
- `harita.html` — Interactive map page showing my navigation route  
- `and english versions of these`
---

## 🧩 Technologies Used
- **HTML5** – multi-page layout  
- **CSS3** – responsive design, theme toggle, and hover animations  
- **Leaflet.js** – open-source mapping library (used instead of OpenLayers)  
- **Git & GitHub Pages** – version control and hosting  

---

## 🌐 Why Leaflet Instead of OpenLayers?
Although the assignment suggested **OpenLayers**, this project uses **Leaflet.js** as an alternative open-source mapping library.  
Reasons for this choice:
- Easier to learn and integrate for a small personal project  
- Lightweight (~40 KB) and performs smoothly on mobile  
- Fully supports base layers and vector routes  
- Ideal for educational and lightweight WebGIS applications  

---

## ✈️ Map Description
The map visualizes a **training flight route** around Ankara using the Leaflet library.  
The route is approximately **125 NM (230 km)** and takes around **1 hour 20 minutes** in a Cessna 172 aircraft.  
Users can switch between **default** and **satellite** layers and view waypoint names.

**Route:**  
Etimesgut Airfield → Şehitali → Temelli → Polatlı → Haymana → Bala → İkizce Pond → Etimesgut Airfield

---

## 🧠 Learning Process & AI Usage
Most issues were first solved by using **Google** and **official documentation** (HTML, CSS, Leaflet).  
AI tools (ChatGPT Gemini and Grok) were used **only for minor assistance**, such as:
- Improving the theme toggle (light/dark mode)  
- Simplifying responsive layout  
- Debugging JavaScript for the map  

> **AI usage time:** ~3–3.5 hours  
> **Workflow:** Google → Documentation → ChatGPT (if needed)

---

## 💡 What I Learned
- Building multi-page responsive websites  
- Integrating Leaflet maps and adding interactive layers  
- Using CSS variables and animations  
- Hosting a project on GitHub Pages  

---

## 🧾 Git Usage
Version control was managed through Git with multiple commits on different days,
but only the last commit includes my all finished webpage.
